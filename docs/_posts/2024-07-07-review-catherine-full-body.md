title:  "Review: Catherine: Full Body"

I just finished playing "Catherine: full body" this week. And I have
had a lot of thoughts about that game. So I am going to write a
review/analysis to structure my thoughts. I wrote a few game review
over the years, but never that extensive and I have written one in a
while. Which one was the last? _checking_ Next Jump: Shmup Tactics? In
2018? Ok, that was a while back!

I played the game on the Nintendo Switch, I think it is the DLC included
release of the PS4 game, which itself was an extension of "Catherine"
on the PS3.

## Overview

This game is quite story driven. So I'll split my review in two parts,
a spoiler-free part first, and a probably longer part with spoiler
I'll mark them clearly. I have read very little about the game before
I got it. And I chose to read more about the game afterward to give a
more pure feedback of how I felt about it. Though, I have seen some
parts are controversial.

The game is a horror dating-simulator puzzle game. It seems to be set
in the world of Personna 3 and seem to share quite a bit of the
development team.

You play Vincent, an early 30s man who has been with his girlfriend
Katherine for quite some time. (They met first in high school; they
got together towards the end of college; it's been about 10 years.)
She wants to get married, Vincent is uncertain. That causes Vincent to
feel a lot of pressure, to drink a lot, to have nightmares. And on the
first day of the game, Vincent meets a cute promiscuous girl,
Catherine, who he sleeps with. (Yes, the girlfriend is Katherine, the
_mistress_ is Catherine, and a third girl who eventually comes is
Qatherine, called Rin in most of the game.)

Every night, Vincent has nightmares wheer he looks like a sheep, and
with other sheeps he is forced to climb gigantic wall by crafting a
path to the top while the world collapse below his feet. This plays as
a puzzle game where Vincet finds  path to the top of a wall by
rearranging blocks in the wall to find a path to the top.

Every day, Vincent tries to manage his relation with Katherine and
Catherine and figure out what he wants to do. Manage the expectation
of a long term girlfriend and the pressure that she feels from her
family and friends, manage the expectation of society on him, try to
reconcile the fact that he cheated on his girlfriend when he was
drunk, manage the fear of his nightmares. This plays as a dating sim
really, with pre recorded clips and playable scenes at a bar where Vincent
talk to friends, patrons, and staff while answering phone calls and
text messages.

## Audience

The game is rated M, or whatever is 18+ in your region. It is a horror
game even though it is not designed to play on your fear, but the fear
of Vincent, it can get disturbing and gory at times. The game is
unapologethicaly sexual. While you do not get an explicit sex scene
(and thank god, I played it with my wife watching TV on the couch; she
wouldn't mind; still awkward), there is no doubt of what is going on,
and the game would probably have been censored in some regions if the
camera was placed in any other way. And the game has to be this sexual
for it to work.

I am not the prime target of the game. The game is obviously targetted
at mid 20s, early 30s men to get them to think and reflect about sex,
gender, long term relationships, sexual orientation, and pressure of
society. Men older than that probably have explored these questions
already, so it may not be as impactful.

I am not sure that teenagers should play this; not in the sex for teen
bad kind of sense, but more in the sense that I don't think the themes
and messages of the game would hit home. I remember recommending my
son waits until he is older to watch Oldboy (2003); not in the sex and
gore bad for teen kind of way. But more in the sense that to get the
emotional impact of the movie, you need to be emotionally really to parse it.

Women probably can learn from this game, and maybe get an experience
of what men feel around questions of aging, commitment, pressure. It
has things to say about the LGBTQ community. And I'll be interested to
see both women and trans view of the game.

## So is it a good game?

I am gonna go with yes. The story(ies) it tells is(are) interesting. I
am writing this review because I beat the game 2 days ago, and I am
still thinking about it. But, as a game, it can fall a little flat.

### Poor puzzle mechanics

My primary problem with the game is the puzzle mechanic. The
integration of the puzzle mechanics is just terrible in my
mind. Nothing Vincent does out of the puzzle really impact what is happening
inside the puzzle, and nothing Vincent does in the puzzle seem to be
impacting what is impacting outside the puzzle.

It doesn't matter if you try to be with Katherine or Catherine, the
puzzle play exactly the same. It does not matter how many points you
get in the puzzle, the dating sim plays exactly the same. Narratively,
having to overcome a gigantic wall that collapse under Vincent feet while
being chased by his fear is great. But you have to do three of those
a night, and frankly it could have been two. Or one!

The puzzle is not good enough to be interesting as a puzzle. When I
replayed the game (to get different endings), I played in the easiest
mode to be able to skip the puzzles. It seems it is a feature that
they added in the "full body" edition because I guess they realized
the game was too slow.

### Meaningless choices

There is another problem that I realized mid way in my first
playthrough, which became **excrutiating** on my second
playthrough. For a game where you make choices that impact the
story, most of your choices do not actually impact the story that much.

Your choices and action impact the story in two ways. Vincent's interactions
with side characters will impact their long term fate as well, but
they are the side show, not the primary story. The meat of the game is
that Vincent's actions towards Katherine, Catherine, and Qatherine and the
answers to morality questions throughout the game will impact what
the relationship status will be at the end of the game.

My problem with that is that it impacts the relationship status *at
the end of the game*. The game takes place in 9 days and whatever you
do, the cutscenes which drive the narrative are going to be exactly
the same (put a star on that for later remarks) for the first 7
days. Vincent can be all lovey-dovey towards Katherine or be a complete
jerk towards her, the first 7 days will unfold the same.

The (original) game released in 2011 (full body in 2019), we knew how
to make branching story lines in 2011. Most of the cutscenes are
mostly in the rendering engine of the game, so it is not like the
developers would have to redraw many complex animations. The game
tells you to replay it to see how else it could have unfolded, but 75%
of the story is the same.

### Bad skips

The game spends a lot of time loading. You go answer a quetion before
the next level, the game loads statistics about the questions globally
(which is cool), but they don't change much, so loading them on a
second playthrough is kind of a waste of time. Then the narrator
introduces the next puzzle level and hurdles, which if you intend to
skip it is a waste of time. Then it loads the level, which you will
skip. Then it loads the next cut scene, which on a third play through
you probably want to skip because you've seen it twice already.

So on replaying the game, you spend a lot of time wishing you could
skip the pieces you don't care about. There could be a skip while
loading feature. This could be a config setting that removes the
global statistics on questions. There is autoplay in the levels, that
is good; what about autoplay at 3x speed?

### Story telling

Now you may think I didn't like the game. But actually I did like it a
lot. The story telling is good. I'll say more in the spoiler section
in a minute. But seeing a good (maybe great) game hindered by small
things is annoying. Especially in a game that makes it clear there are
lots of endings (13 I think), bad UI is vey annoying.

## Spoilers ahead

If you haven't played the game, I think you probably should play it
before reading further. I'll just assume that you have played it.

## My first playthrough (Katherine alternate ending)

In my first playthrough, I reached what is known online as the
Katherine alternate ending. I did not know how the game was
structured. I was wondering if there was a path to live a double life,
so I tried to keep both Katherine and Catherine happy.

Turns out, narratively the game doesn't let you do that. By the time I
realized that the game will force you to choose, the meter was
slightly on the Katherine side. I tried to commit to the Katherine
line but that was too late to bring the meter to "max order", and I
had sent Qatherine piano video to Katherine which triggers the
alternate ending.

I think this is the best ending of the whole game. It makes a lot of
sense narratively. Let's see the story progression in that path.

Vince is unconfortable commiting to Katherine. So he gets drinks too
much and cheats on her with Catherine. He does not come clean to
Katherine even though she tells him she is pregnant. He keeps on
sleeping with Catherine who he does not tell he is in a long term
relationship yet. When he gets a call from Steve claiming he is
K/Catherine boyfriend, he tries to leverage that to get out of first
Catherine's relationship and then of Katherine relationship. He does
not come out and say "turns out I think you are cheating on me, so
let's break things up". No! He tries to manipulate them into breaking
up with him because he can't gather the resolve to end the relations
himself. Vincent is a piece of shit; he does not deserve happiness!

Now, Catherine is a succubbus trying to manipulate him to break up
with Katherine. And Katherine was fed false information and she is not
actually pregnant. But from Vincent perspective, he could not keep it in
his pants and he doesn't take responsibility about it until he is
forced to.  By the time Vincent wants to commit to Katherine, she is
done with him. She is ready to pursue a better life for herself; and
she succeed!

Good for her! You go girl!

## Other endings

After that, I played the other endings. I started with the "order"
endings (Katherine True, Katherine Good, Catherine Bad). Then the
"chaos" endings (Catherine True, Catherine Good, Katherine Bad). The
freedom endings. And the Qaterine endings.

I am kind of upset that there are so many good endings for Vincent. He
shows bad character for about the first 6 days until he turns around
in the last mile. There are 13 endings. 2 out of 4 of the Katherine
endings are good for Vincent. 3 out of the 4 Catherine endings are
good for him. 2 out of the 3 Qatherine endings are good for him, and
1 of the 2 freedom endings are good.

### Katherine Good and True endings

The endings where he ends up with Katherine are the most upsetting
because there is little accountability for Vincent.

So in story, after sleeping with Catherine for a week and eventually
breaking up with her. The psycho Catherine tries to kill both Vincent
and Katherine in a latch ditch attempt to get Vincent to break up with
Katherine. But it turns out that Catherine essentially is an illusion
that is not visible to other humans and maybe even only in his
dream. So **technically** he didn't actually cheat on Katherine.  Just
go ahead and try to tell your significant other that you did not
**technically** cheat on them: you wanted to sleep with someone else,
you thought you actually did sleep with someone else, repeatedly, you
lied to both of them for a week, and you told your friend (and
Katherine's) about it. Let's see how that goes!

And Katherine is a bit guilty too because she did not tell him right
away when she finds out she is not actually pregnant. But she really
had no opportunity since Vincent spend the back half of the game avoiding
Katherine.

I am not saying that redemption is not possible in relationships. This
clearly happens; Alexander Hamilton did the
[unimagineable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMAoOGnw9qQ) after
all. But the "I went back to my imagination to risk my life and
confront the bad guy to agree to tell you that Catherine wasn't real"
really doesn't quite cut it for me. That is not redemption! That is
not making amends; That's an excuse!

### Freedom Bad feels right

I kind of like the freedom endings. In the freedom endings, Vincent
realizes that his relation with Katherine is broken beyond repair and
that he doesn't actually want to repair it. As the player, this has
been obvious since he tried to get Katherine to tell him that she was
cheating on him (she wasn't).

The two cleanly break up and Vincent grows as a result looking for new
opportunities and new directions in his life. This feels organic to
the story. Now in the freedom bad ending Vincent tries to gamble to
get an easy way out and gets punished for it because Karma! And that
feels right to me: no easy way out for cheats!

The freedom good ending sees Vincent win his gamble and make a bunch
of money out of it to fund his new life style. That's a bit of an easy
way out for his character. But frankly to it so hard as a player to
get there, that I kind of get it.

### Katherine Bad and Catherine Bad

Bad endings for both Catherine and Katherine feel right to me. To get
there, Vincent needs to have been fairly inconsistent in his
choices. For Katherine Bad, Vincent needs to have made plenty of
choices against and at the last moment try to still get the girl. That
shouldn't work, and it doesn't. In that situation Vincent is trying to
grasp at straws and salvage a deeply broken relation.

It works the same for the Catherine bad ending, Vincent wants to get
married and get steady with the sexy succubus. But really Vincent is
trying to push his life model on her. You said no Catherine, good for
you!

### Catherine Good and True

I'll group the two endings of Caterine (good and true) because
narratively they are only marginally different. These are the endings
where Vincent realize that he likes doing whatever he wants. That he
wants to get free of the shackle of societal expectation.  And so,
let's get with the sexy succubus.

I really like these endings narratively. Throughout the game, Vincent
really shows that he doesn't want to get with Katherine because he
doesn't want to commit and he doesn't like the pressure of
society. Realizing that you don't have to abide by what society
expects of you is a message that I wish more people received. Yes
there are consequences for that (Vincent has to move to hell) but that
doesn't mean it is not a valid choice.

### Catherine alternate

In Catherine alternate ending, Catherine is moved by the power of
piano music and chose to go back in time and become human to make it
work with Vincent but earlier in his life.

Hum... What? This is the strangest ending of the game
narratively. That is a radical change in Catherine life. And she makes
it because piano is pretty, somehow....

Come on, I'm sure you can write this better!

### Alright that's all the endings. Right?

Surely I did not forget any endings of the game. What? I forgot Rin's
ending. Yeah, I wanted to talk about that at the end.

Rin's ending apparently are controversial. It turns out many people
hated Rin's ending. Rin was added in "full body" and some people say
it distract from the main story. And I don't disagree with that. If
you are doing a Katherine or Catherine route, the game spends a lot of
time focusing on Rin. And in these routes, Rin is a distraction.

But we all know, that's not why most people have problems with Rin's endings.

## Rin's ending

It turns out that Rin is not a girl. The game makes it very clear
that, to quote Orlando, "the kid is packing heat". This is not a
heterosexual relation. And many people are uncomfortable and quite
hateful of non-heterosexual relation. And I think that's why it got a
bad rep; the "how but it delays from the core story" sound like
rationalization to me.

But through the character of Rin (and it turns out Erica), the game
explores the question of societal expectation and sexuality even more
deeply than it could without.

### Identity

The game makes is clear that Rin is a guy. Even though Rin looks like
a girl. And it turns out that Rin is actually an alien (a male alien)
that changed form to integrate in society and eventually becomes human
in some of the endings. So Rin's identity is complex. But Rin is
clearly Queer and coded as a transwomen. (I say coded as,
because... alien. I guess you could argue for non-binary.)

The gmae uses pronouns correctly throughout the game. (And here, I
have to say I played the game in English, if anyone knows how that
plays in Japanese, let me know.) Everyone refers to Rin as _she_
throughout most of the game. Once Rin identity is known, I do not
think that anyone refers to Rin using a pronoun. Vincent and the team
refers to Rin by name. The only person that doesn't is Katherine when
Vincent tells her he is attracted to "not exactly a women" (this is
how Vincent puts it). She probably guess that Vincent refers to Rin
because Katherine uses the pronoun _they_. The alien refer to Rin as
"brother" which is accurate from their perspective.

Now the game never shows Rin express preference onto which pronouns are
appropriate. But that the game addresses the question (although in a
subtle way) is good writing.

(Ill go ahead and refer to Rin in the feminine because that feels right.)

### Vincent initial reaction

Vincent is attracted to Rin when he thinks Rin is a women. He
discovers Rin's true identity when he sees Rin naked and has Rin's
junk in front of his face. 2 minutes later Rin confess her undying
love and Vincent freaks out.

Yes Vincent is quite insensitive. But I kind of get it.  This is the
point of the game where he thinks his girlfriend is pregnant while he
sleeps with the hot blonde every night and hasn't slept well in a
week. And now he discover the women he has a crush on actually is
packing heat. That's a lot of emotion to sort out at the same time!

### Positivity

The game makes it clear immediately using Erica, that it is not an
acceptable reaction and that Vincent needs to apologize. Which he
does, immediately.

Whether or not you enter Rin's route, the game makes it clear that
Rin's situation is uncommon, that it is complex to deal with. But it
never portrays Rin as unnatural or wrong. Some character may express
surprise at who Rin is, or surprise towards Vincent reaction to
Rin. But it is always is a fairly positive way.

The game is actually quite positive towards queer identities. The game
reveals that Erica is a trans-woman who was known as Eric in high
school before spending some time in a hospital. The game presents
Erica as a woman and never veers from that. In some flashback, we can
see that she wasn't always a woman. The game shows alternative timelines
before she transitions.

But after transition Erica is always treated as a women. The 3d model
is that of a women. She behaves lie a women. Other characters treat
her like a women. Her friends that knew her before she transitioned
treat her as a women. And she gets in a relation with a man (Toby) who
does not initially know but who seem to have no problem with it once
he knows the truth.

I am not queer, but I know a few people who are. I think they would
like this portrayal.

### So what did I think of Rin's endings?

Meh, they're ok! Narratively, Rin's bad ending is probably the better
written one. It has Vincent fall in love with Rin but he is not ready for
the implications of Rin's identity. And so the relation can't go forward.

The good and true ending are narratively the same. They involve
convincing Rin's brother (who, I remind you, are aliens) that Vincent is
worth it by climbing ever more walls. And somehow that makes sense.  I
suppose you can read it as Vincent has accepted Rin's identity, but
now needs to Rin's family to accept Vincent, a lowly human. But it is
a bit too quick to hit home for me. I think spending more time on
Vincent understanding better and accepting Rin's identity would be
better narratively.

But I like the story overall, so maybe I don't care too much.

## After thoughts

I think the gender, sexual, relation parts of the story are the most
interesting in the game. But the other big theme of the story are
society's force as a normalizer.

Katherine feels the pressure of society. From her friends, her parents
who think that she needs to get married and have kids. I am sure that
rings true to many women out there. Vincent feels the pressure of
getting married with Katherine, especially after Vincent thinks she is
pregnant. Vincent's friends are pushing him to do what is right.

The main antagonist in the game "Boss" is the agent of society. He
sees man who are not commited in their relations as sheep to be
herded. Because societies needs more babies to survive. And it is a
good thing (in the mind of Boss representing society) to kill all the
men who are not committed because babies more important. Remember it
is a Japanese game with quite a natality problem. The game was
released in 2011, but I am writing this in 2024; after Roe v. Wade was
overturned, which makes it quite relevant in the US as well.

The game is clear, society and organizations are willing to herd you,
and, if not possible, are willing to cull you to survive. The game
also shows you that while society tries to normalize you, you do not
have to be normalized, and you can chose to be your own person!

So did I like the game, yeah I think I did!
