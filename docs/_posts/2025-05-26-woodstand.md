title:  "Making wood stands"

## Goals

I wanted to make two stands made of wood for two different
purpose. One was to elevate my desktop computer so that it does not
stand on the floor (and hopefully get less dust) and take the
opportunity to put it on casters so that it is easier to move when I
need to plug stuff in. The second was to make a stand for the rice
dispensers we have. Sitting directly on the ground seem to be prone to
bugs getting in. Hopefully if it is elevated, getting bugs in would be
harder.

## Plans

The plan is pretty simple, a 2 layer design: the bottom layer is a
butt-jointed rectangular frame. On top, put slates like on a bed. It
is meant to be reminescent of the [workbench]({% post_url

**put here planning notes**


## Building it

So the idea is to process 2x4 in all the same thickness and cut all to
size in one go. So that I can just assemble afterward.

After making the first cut, it became obvious that the 2x4 is too
thick and that it's going to look weird for an item so small. So I'll
resaw the 2x4 in about half.

And after cutting here is a pre-assembly/finishing rendering.

I sanded everything from 50 grit to 120 grit because after assembly
sanding will get much harder.


Let's go glue. I'll glue the bases together. And at the same time, I
glue the first slate on since it aligns perfectly with the base. It's
funny how when I play with wood, my hands always end up sticky!

After glueing them up (and a quicker sand), it is time for staining. I
wiped on some minwax dark walnut. I quite like the colors it
gives. (Even though pine is a bit blotchy, even after prestain is applied.)

After a million coats of spray on lacquer, it is ready to install. The
rice stand was sized to fit exactly in a cabinet hole in my
kitchen. (Yeah, they did this hting in the 90s where they built desk
inside kitchens so you could take phone calls on the landline there.)

I'll just need to add the casters on the computer one.
