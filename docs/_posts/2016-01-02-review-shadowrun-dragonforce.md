I am a long time player of tabletop RPGs and tactical RPGs and I must say that I loved this game. I just finished the game for the first time in Hard difficulty and I plan on playing it again in the highest difficulty next. The game is the second in a serie of (currently 3) but I feel like the stories are disconnected so you probably can play them in any order.

The story is great and well set in the shadowrun universe. Characters are well written with a deeper and often darker aspect to discover. The storyline is not too complex to follow but complex enough to enjoy.

The battles in the game know how to be stressful. Many of the "fights" are very well scripted with multiple actions to take in sequence that increase pressure on you. For instance there is a battle where you need to press two switching in two rooms in the real world while your decker has to open the way for you from the matrix. The game knows how to keep you on edge.

Graphics are nothing too fancy but perfectly integrated in the style of the game. Though I played on a not so good for gaming laptop and had to set graphics setting low.

The main issues I had with this game are linked to the UI. It can be very frustrating at times. Here are a few things I found annoying in the interface. I'll detail that because I hope the developpers will read this and do what they can in future versions. I give a fairly long list but that is mostly to the developpers benefit. The game is good !


-The combat rules are somewhat kept unknown. It is not clear to me what each statistic is doing or what some of the acronym stand for. A particular instance: Some weapon have a Ar-P statistic which I guess stands for Armor Piercing. When using it some of the armor points of the enemy unit blinks but seem to come back in the same round. I guess Armor Piercing is different from Armor Striping but making it clear would be nice. In the current form Armor seems to be a typical DR (damage reduction) and it is not clear to me that there is a real difference in practice between +3 Ar-P and +3 DMG.

-the UI can be very hard to read for me. Maybe it is becuase I am color blind but the overlays in same tone can be quite hard to read. In particular, the techniques icon in the matrix often features white writing on white background and the cooldown of a not yet used technique can be hard to read.

-the HP of an enemy can be very hard to read because its health bar is essentially hovering over the units head but whatever is behind that unit can make it hard to read. Even pointing to the unit does not really help: more information appear in box that is transparent and depending on what is behind the text might be very hard to read. It could be fixed by giving a setting for the opacity of these infobox.

-It is sometimes hard to understand what an action will do some actions might require you to move first but the "trajectory line" is small so you might not realize your character will have to move to accomplish this action. In comparison in FireEmblem, a (too) heavy line will show you the path your character will take.

-Some attacks can damage neighbooring unit (shotguns, miniguns, glory's closecombat), it would be good if the units potentially in the line of fire could be indicated. especially the shotgun widespread shot can be fairly hard to predict.

-It can be very hard to point to some tiles in the game. Trying to move 4 characters on a 2x2 area is very difficult because you keep on pointing to one of the character.

-When healing outside of combat, I find it annoying that I can not see who has inventory and who needs healing. A simple tweak would be to display a "currentHP"/"maxHP" information next to the character's name in the "who to heal" dialog.

-In terms of gameplay, some things were annoying as well. You can not give an ally an item once the mission has started. I ended up in ridiculous situations where the leaders inventory was full but Glory's inventory was empty and when finding an item I had to send it to the stash.

-It would be good if some action (reload in particular) could span between two rounds. Often with the apex' drone shooting costs 2AP and reloading costs 2AP but the drone only has 3 AP. I'd like to be able to fire, start reloading and pay -1AP next round to complete reloading.
