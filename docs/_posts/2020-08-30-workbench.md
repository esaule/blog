# Workbench

After building the shelving unit, I realized I was in dire need of a
workbench to work in my garage. I lack a work surface to work
comfortably when standing. I lack easily accessible storage area while
I am cutting wood. I lack an infeed/outfeed table when cutting wood on
the table saw.

So the plan is to build a work bench to be mobile. I have seen [Steve
Ramsey's BMW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFrWBdb0OjU) and being
mobile seems easy and a good idea. Though I don't like that precise
plan; it's too big and too cabinet-y. I think I'll go for a 3 shelf
bench in a plan that is similar to the [shelving unit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-07-07-shelvingunit.md %}) I built
recently. I can use the top shelf for work surface, and the bottom two
for storing tools or wood being cut or to cut, or to let work piece dry, ...

The frame is built about the same as the shelving unit. It is built out
of 2x4 cut and resawed to appropriate dimensions. It all uses half lap
joints, dados, and rabbets. These are strong joints and provided there
could be heavy pieces set on it, it seems like a good joint to
use. It's at the smaller size than the other one I built. Also the
bottom uses a bigger piece of wood to help with strength and that's
where the wheels will be attached. Here is a picture of the frame
before gluing it together.

Turns out gluing the frame together was kind of a mess because I don't
have a clamp long enough to apply pressure in the longest dimension. So
I used tape to apply pressure. I think I'll need some kind of a band
clamp because check out how it looked.

The top is a panel of 2x4 similar to the panels I used for the
[bookshelves]( {{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_posts/2019-12-27-bookshelf-1.md %} ). I think a proper 2x4 panel will
be good to make the top strong enough for potential tool drop, or to
clamp pieces to it when working on it. Here is a picture of the panel glue up.

The panel turned out with good strong joints but the boards were not
necessarily well aligned along the y-axis. So I was up for a lot of
sanding. (Is woodworking 50% sanding?) Here is a picture that shows what I mean.

After sanding the top and planing it (by sanding some more) so that it
does not rock on the frame, I was ready to glue the top shelf to the
frame.

I thought about how to do the middle shelves for a while. I ended up
being inspired by the design of an [ikea trolley](
https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/bekvaem-kitchen-cart-birch-30240348/ )
and chose to go with slats. It is probably lighter and nicer
looking. They are all 2x4 resawed in third with rabbets at the end so
they fall precisely in the inbetween of the frame.

I thought, it is a piece that will sit in the garage. So I could
either not care about the finishing. Or I could use that as a way to
experiment with finishing. Since I'll see the workbench about
everyday, I went for painting the frame and staining the surfaces with
a dark stain. Because I am an idiot, I should have finished the frame
and the slats BEFORE gluing the slats in place. So I got bad memories
from the [staircase refinishing project]( {{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_posts/2019-03-30-stairs-done.md %} ).

But in the end it looks great! That third coat of poly on the top made
the whole difference. I think that could be the most intricate project
I have done so far. And also the nicest looking one. It's kind of a
shame it is going to sit in the garage...

In the future, maybe I'll attach a vice to the side. We'll see with usage.
