The workbench was a good improvement in the garage for when I
work. But there is a need to improve the garage when it is not being
used as a work space. That means that I need both organization for
tools. And organization for stuff stored in there.

So I am building a cleat wall to store tools. It seemed nice to both
use wall surfaces as storage while maintaining easy access of the
tools. It is still fairly sparse now. But I'll build the modules over time.

I also built an other shelving unit just for garage storage. Since I
did not care how it looked like, I thought I could YOLO it without
caring about squaring all board. It turned out that was a mistake. I
had alignment problems because boards were not straight. Also, I did
not go for complex joints. I pretty much screwed everything together.

Though, it turns out that once I aligned the unit with the wall, the
ground is not flat. So the unit is tilting forward. I may have to
unscrew it and rescrew it to get it straight...
