My house in on a slope, so they had to dig to plane the ground when
the house was built. So there is wall that hold the soil out of where the dig was.

The wall is built out of retired railroad beams. They were in dire
need of a cleaning and painting. So we pressure washed the wall. That
took a couple of days. That wall was so much in need of a pressure cleaning.

And them we repainted. Look at the different before and after. (The
top right beams have a first coat.)

The cans of paint were giving some ideas of how much paint we were
going to need. That was a complete lie, we ended up putting about 3
times the amount of paint that was indicated on the can.

But at least the wall looks nice now!
