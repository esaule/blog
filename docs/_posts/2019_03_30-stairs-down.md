# My stairs are finally done!

My stairs were looking like crap when we got the house. There was a
nasty carpet on it. We had removed carpet from upstairs and there was
only carpet on the stairs. So we decided to strip the carpet and
refinish the stairs.

It took forever to get the job done becasue it was a lot more work than I though.

The carpet was removed back in August 2017 right after we bought the
house.

There was a ton of nails and staples to remove that were used to
secure the carpet. Probably 30 per tread and 30 per rise. It took me
until Thanksgiving 2017 to get rid of all the staples. (Once I removed
the the ones on the tread in September 2017, having an occasional
staple on a rise wasn't a priority.)

When my parents visited over Christmas we looked into how to refinish
the stairs.  Removing and reattaching the rails seemed too
difficult. Eventually it seemed that sanding, staining, poly on the
treads and paint on the rise was the way to go.

We started sanding with an oscillating tool (to be able to get between
the rails). But the key problem was that the staples and nails left the
wood very damaged. So there was a need to use a wood filler and sand
again. That took me until May 2018 to gather the time to get rid of
all the hole.

The wear and tear on the stairs was very non-uniform because of the
carpet in the middle and the staining and protective coating on the
sides, the wood needed a LOT of sanding. Summer was pretty much spent
sanding. Sanding inside the house is NOT fun. 

Here is what they looked like in January 2019 after applying stain to
one tread to see how it goes. Note all the patching that necessary on
the rise, there was just as much on the treads, it is just VERY sanded.

Staining all the tread was done in February 2019. The next step was
painting the rise and the trim. But before painting there was a need
to set up painter's tape to avoid messing up the stained tread. The
geometry of the stairs is a lot more complicated than I
anticipated. And because of that setting up the tape took about a full
day. 

Here is what the stairs looked like once the rise and trim were painted:

After painting the rail (and setting and removing tape) here is what it finally looked like.

So overall, there was about 20 days of work on the stairs. Of course,
I did not know what I was doing so I wasted time. But mostly, it took
about a year and a half to get it done because I was doing that on
week ends when nothing more urgent needed to be done.

If I had to do some more work on the stairs, I'd change the 90 degree
turn and use proper wood rather than the plywood that was under the
carpet.

I learnt in the process that I liked working with wood. Eventually
turned out that I'll do some more woodworking!

(I had taken more pictures, if I find them, I'll add them back here.)
