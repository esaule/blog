# Review: Templar Battleforce

For reference, I just beat the campaign for the first time (I played in normal). I usually like turn by turn strategy and tactical games like civilization, fire emblem, shining force, ...

Templar Batteleforce is a tactical rpg type game which is mostly a sequence of fights with team building in between fights; in the same way your typical fire emblem would be.

It took me about 40 hours to beat the game for the first time which makes the game an appropriate length in my opinion. It is about 40-ish battles. The game features many difficulty level and probably has a reasonnable replay value. I plan on at least playing the full game a second time, and probably more to explore different team builds.

What really did the game for me is how battles are constructed. Essentially the better you "score" in a battle, the more experience and RP (essentially money) you get out of the battle. The score is essentially computed depending on how fast you accomplished the objectives, how many ennemie you killed and how many secondary objective (often unknown to you in advance) you accomplished. This gives a sense of urgency in the battles, encourages you to explore, but exploring is dangerous.

An interesting mechanic in the game is the concept of "heat points". Essentially all movement and action a character does makes its suit heat. And when overheated, he starts taking damage, losing ability to perform some types of action, or completely shut down. It is something that usually does not come in the way too much, but it is also something that you can not ignore.

The team build part of the game is interesting. Essentially the number of "points" you can allocate to characters really mean that you can not max-out a character. You have to make hard choices. For instance, you pretty much have to choose between a scout that can scan large portion of the maps and move fast, and a scout that deals massive damage at a distance; you can try a middle ground but it might not be best. Similarly with the engineer, either you get a tact point expert to help take and control tactical points (which are supply point on the map), or you make a battle engineer which buffs your units and is reasonnably useful in a fight. Doing both is a possible but serious compromise,


One of the problem I have with the team building is that the UI is a bit awkward and it took me almost an entire run through the game before I had a clear enough understanding of the game mechanics to optimize my team carefully. There are a few dimensions to the game system (roll to hit, damage reduction, peircing damage ignore part of the armor, bio-damage do damage in the long run, ...) which are all pretty much independent in the character sheet. It is sometimes hard to see how much point to spend in one aspect. Fortunately, you can "respec" your units from scratch between battles, so if you misunderstood the impact of a game mechanic, you can correct your team building mistakes for the next battle.

In term of difficulty, there are many difficulty levels. I play a lot of tactical games and normal was too easy for me. If you are used to that kind of games, push it one notch up. Though, it seems that at higher level, there is perma death, so... be careful.

I really liked some of the options in the game. Soldiers can use "overwatch" to cover some squares of the map and shoot enemie entering the zone. hydras can use napalm to set some squares of the map on fire causing damage to units passing through. Engineers can build turrets to defend some parts of the map. So overall, I feel like as a player, your decision can shape how the skirmish unfols.

One thing that could be annoying is that the ennemies can pop out of many places with no way for you to know in advance, and they usually play in the turn they appear. So you can get in situation where a unit pops out and deals you damage without much you could have done. (overwatch can be useful there.)

I find that the units you control have a very limitted field of vision. And sometimes, this can be very annoying.

Something good is that the game developpers are quite responsive. I don't know how long they will be maintaining the game. But for now, they reply on the forum almost immediately. I pointed out a bug that was essentially fixed in a day. They take suggestion.

The storyline is pretty much irrelevant. I do not feel like you have a clear control of the story nor a clear idea of the lore of the game. It is a fairly straight forward story, with a bit of details if you want to know more. Clearly the story is not the focus of the game. Overall, I feel like it is appropriate for this type of game.

The graphics are alright. It is a seen from atop game. Nothing fancy, but it works. The graphic style is nice and enjoyable. I appreciated the fact that the style is overall coherent, many smaller games tend to have incoherency in style. But this one is profesionnal.

In term of sounds, the sfx are appropriate, but the background music sucks. The music is really subpar in this game. One of the track is pretty much a mix of a 8-second track with a 16-second track. The others are not much better. It drove my wife crazy. Fortunately, you can shut the music off and leave the sfx, and play your own music in the back. Makes the game much more enjoyable.

In summary, is this game perfect ? no. Is it the best tactical game out there? no. Is it fun and enjoyable? Yes. Is it worth its price? Absolutely.
