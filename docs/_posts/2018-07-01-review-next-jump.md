NEXT JUMP: Shmup Tactics is a weird game.It is a shooting game (think galaga, r-type, ikaruga) that you play turn by turn.

The core of the gameplay are the fight sequence which are typically limited to three turns during which you will try to blow up as many enemy ships (drones) as possible and collect as much scraps as possible (money). The meat of the gameplay is that when you blow up an enemy ship, it will drop scraps (money) and energy (essentially action points). So the game quickly becomes a combo game where you place yourself to shoot as much as you can and gather energy before your turn ends to be able to do more and more damage in the three turn per encounter limit.
These fights give you the feeling of playing a shooting game, in the sense that there are quickly enemy bullets everywhere and you have to navigate that maze o find how to deal the maximum amount of damage,

The rest of the game is actually similar to ftl in the sense that you move in a map where each point will lead to a ight sequence and try to reach sos signals or stores.

Arts, music, and plot are quite forgettable: definitely not the point of the game.

Quite a fun little game!
