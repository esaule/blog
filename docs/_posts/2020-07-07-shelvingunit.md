My wife needed a shelving unit. So I deployed all my 2x4 processing
skills to build a piece of furniture. Used a lot of dado and rabbet to
build the frame. The shelves themselves are high grade plywood.

The whole thing is painted with chalk paint with a clear protective
coat. Some shots:

I like it! And I learned a lot building it.
