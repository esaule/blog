<p>Today I got a call because I applied for a credit card a few days ago. A part of the discussion went like this:
<ul>
<li>In order to verify your identity, I am going to ask you questions ONLY YOU knows the answer of. Are you ready?</li>
<li>Well, how are you going to know whether I lie or not?</li>
<li>I will know! I have the answers in your file.</li>
<li>So you know the answers too, I am not the only one knowing them.</li>
<li> <em>long silence</em></li>
</ul></p> 

<p>These so called security questions makes no sense at all. Anybody that knows me would be able to answer them (my brother, my boss). Anybody that has access to my file will be able to answer them (my banker, my insurer). Anybody that asks me security questions will be able to answer them (phone companies, thousands of websites). Why are we still relying on such obvious questions?</p>
