I play about 1 JRPG every 3 year to avoid the overload of "save the world" stories. I paid the game about 5 bucks, and clearly I got my money worth. Is it the best JRPG out there? No! But it is entertaining.

Story:
This is the first part of a 3 part story. The story is not bad but not great, fairly classic really. I was enjoying it up to the end but the last act made little sense to me. There are 6 characteres with a different twist on the story, I may replay the game in easy with the other characters just to get the rest of the story.
Though I really liked how the story unfolds. In particular, I enjoyed that because you could play any of the 6 characters, the story unfolds with a form of group dynamic rather than a "leader+whoever has a useful/funny line" way. Though it tends to make dialogue phases quite long because each character adds his/her grain of salt.
I liked that the story tries to take a modern look on questions of race, religion, and class to make the player think backabout it. It is never too forced on the player, but the game manages to say what it has to say. Some might say it has a SJW feel, but Ithink it is fairly reasonnably approached, so I was fine with it.

Graphics:
The game is well drawn. I really enjoyed the high quality 2d graphics. It is a bit pixelly and I feel vector graphics would have been better, but the graphics are still really enjoyable.

Music:
Most are forgettable, but some good pieces.

Gameplay:
I think the gameplay is a better point of the game. In particular I liked that your HP/MP (here stamina) reset at each fight, so you never have to heal between fight or micro manage MP. It tends to make you play each fight like the last fight. There are enough effects, combos to keep you entertained. I liked that no weapon is useless, as they can all be upgraded and lead to different build of your team.
It would have been good to give the player a bit more details about the game mechanics, how important is it to get +1 in an attribute, or how are damage of bleeding calculated, that kind of things.

Length:
depends on whether you care about the story or not. But reading most of the text, it took me about 7 hours to get to the final boss, and about 3 hours to beat it. So I would say, you will beat the game between 5 and 10 hours. You can replay the gameto see more dialogue, but that is more a gimmick to extend the life of the game than anything else.

Final comment:
I payed 5 bucks for the game, and it kept me entertained and thinking about it for a couple of days. It is not a bad investment. I bought the prequel DLC, and will probably buy the second and third part once they are released.
The difficulty curve is a bit strange, but I liked that you can change the difficulty setting during the game. I upped the difficulty mid game becasue the lowest difficulty was really too simple. I may rerun the game in higher difficulty.
