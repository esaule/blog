My parents are visiting me for Christmas. I don't see them very much
anymore since we are living on different continents. I wanted to spend
some time with my dad, and I wanted to get into woodworking. So
killing two birds with one stone, we worked on building a bookshelf.

Well I call it a book shelf, but what I want to build a cubes that
will be eventually painted and stacked on each other.

I watched a lot of [Steve Ramsey's woodworking for mere
mortal](https://www.youtube.com/user/stevinmarin/videos) which
convinced me that the job wouldn't be too difficult. We got a table
saw and some 2-by-4. And started cutting to size, edge jointing the
board, gluing up panels. We finally assembled the box by using some
kind of a box joint we made by laying out the panel creatively.

After sanding, here is what it looks like at the end. (Yeah I also
built an insert to go inside.)

Am I a woodworker now?
