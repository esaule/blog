# Migrating to GitHub

After being hosted by deblan for a while, I realized I stopped
blogging for years. The deblan hosting was great but the system to
update was a bit more complicated. Updating a github page is much
easier, write in markdown and your done.

We lose the comments, but the spam was so bad anyway that I stopped
publishing comments and there were over 10000 waiting for moderation.

So, welcome here.
