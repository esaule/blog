This is not really a game. This is a story, with a little bit of gameplay here and there to get you to do something, in the graphical style of 80's JRPGs.

The story has no words or text, but the stoy is told through piano music and pixel animation.

This is a very cute story which is told with a lot of visual poetry.

This is not for everyone and it is short (about one hour), but I am glad I played it.
